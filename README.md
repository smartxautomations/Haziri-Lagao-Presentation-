## The Vision

### The Problem We Solve

Traditional attendance systems in Pakistani educational institutions face significant challenges:

- **Paper-based records** are time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to analyze
- **Parents remain uninformed** about their child's daily attendance until report card distribution
- **Administrators lack real-time insights** into attendance patterns across the institution
- **Leave management** involves cumbersome paperwork and delays
- **No unified system** connects all stakeholders in the attendance ecosystem

### Our Solution

Haziri Lgao reimagines attendance management by creating a **connected ecosystem** where:

- 📱 **Students** scan their personalized QR-coded ID cards at entry/exit points
- 🔔 **Parents** receive instant push notifications when their child arrives or leaves school
- 📊 **Administrators** access real-time dashboards with comprehensive analytics
- 📝 **Leave requests** are processed digitally with AI-powered automation
- 🔐 **Security gatekeepers** efficiently manage entry/exit with quick scanning capabilities
